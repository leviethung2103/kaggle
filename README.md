Digit Recognizer - Kaggle Competition

Download Datasets I've created at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qvwEx36fjehIntfdFDDWLIrsuFd7c6dk/view?usp=sharing

Unzip the dataset, then we have 2 folders `train` and `test` 

The code is written in jupyter notebook. 

I've got 96.757 % accuracy in digit detection
